# **QRonster - The "Useless But Useful" QR Generator**

## **📌 Project Pitch for Class Presentation**

**Professor & Class,**

Let me introduce you to **QRonster**—a QR code generator that’s *technically useful* but also *delightfully unnecessary*.

---

### **🤔 Why Did I Build This?**

At first glance, QR generators are everywhere. So why make another one? Because:

- Most free QR generators **expire** after 15 days (annoying!).
- Some make you **sign up** (why?).
- Others look like they were designed in **2005**.

So I built **QRonster**:  
✅ **No sign-ups**  
✅ **No expiring codes**  
✅ **No nonsense**

But is it *completely* useless? **Yes and no.**

### **💡 The "Useless But Useful" Paradox**

#### **Why It’s *Useless*:**  
🔹 **You can just Google "QR generator"** (but where’s the fun in that?).  
🔹 **QR codes are boring** (until you add sarcastic roasts).  
🔹 **Nobody needs another QR tool** (but now you have this one).

#### **Why It’s *Useful*:**  
🔸 **Custom logos & colors** (make it pretty!).  
🔸 **No third-party tracking** (your data stays yours).  
🔸 **Instant PNG download** (no watermarks, no paywalls).

### **🎭 The Roasting Feature (Because Why Not?)**

While you wait for your QR code, **QRonster roasts you** with messages like:

- *"This QR code has better uptime than your side projects."*  
- *"Even your grandma could scan this."*  
- *"Your code might have bugs, but this QR won’t."*

Because if you’re generating a QR code, you **deserve** some entertainment.

### **🛠 Tech Stack (Simple & Effective)**

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS** (no bloated frameworks)  
- **QR Code Styling Library** (for fancy designs)  
- **No backend** (because who needs servers?)

---

### **🎤 Final Thoughts**

Is this project **revolutionary?** No.  
Is it **fun and functional?** Absolutely.

QRonster exists because:  
1. **Sometimes you just need a QR code.**  
2. **Sometimes you need a laugh.**  
3. **And sometimes you build things just because you can.**

So go ahead—**generate a QR code, get roasted, and enjoy the absurdity.**

**Thanks for listening!** 🚀

*(P.S. If you actually use this, I won’t judge.)*
